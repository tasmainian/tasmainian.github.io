Either using Terminal or Git Bash, go inside both those folders and run:\n\n```\ngit init\n```\nand then:\n\n```\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/McFeelio/Adoptation/\n```\nand also:\n\n```\ngit pull origin master\n```\n\nYou might have to enter your GitHub username/password somewhere inbetween those steps, depending on your setup. Once that's all done, you should have everything you need to import the project to Eclipse.\n\n### Setting up Eclipse\n\nFire up Eclipse, and when the *workspace selector* pops up, navigate to that **first** folder you created earlier (the one I called *Adoptation Workspace*). Click launch.\n\nThen all you have to do is import the project. Just go to *File -> Import -> General -> Existing project into Workspace*. Where it asks for the destination, just browse to that second folder (the one I called *Adoptation*) and click okay. The whole project should then be shown on the left, and you won't have to do any of this shit again. \n\n## Making and Pushing Commits\n\nWhile I personally like having people make their own branches, it can get complicated and this is a pretty small project so we'll all just yolo push to the master branch. Just make sure you're only making commits after you've done *significant work* (i.e. adding a single if statement probably doesn't beg a new commit), and the commit messages are meaningful so if we have to revert back for some reason, it's easy to do so.\n\nIn case you forget how to properly create and push a commit, first stage all your changes:\n\n```\ngit add *\n```\n\nthen commit them:\n\n```\ngit commit -m \"YOUR DANK DESCRIPTION HERE\"\n```\n\nand finally push them:\n\n```\ngit push origin master\n```\n\nAlright hopefully this helps and lemme know if you have any problems.\n\n- Owen\n"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"A website that uses ReactJS to call a nutrition API and lists items on menus of nearby locations that abide by the users dietary restrictions","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg5MTAyMDQ=","name":"ServesUp","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"2 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/ServesUp","primaryLanguage":{"name":"JavaScript"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"HTML"},{"name":"CSS"},{"name":"JavaScript"}]},"readme":{"text":"This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `npm start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br>\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br>\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n### `npm test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\nSee the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.\n\n### `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\nSee the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.\n\n### `npm run eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**\n\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\n\nYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\n"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"A terminal based python application that identifies incorrect terminal commands and automatically fixes them","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM2NzkxOTM=","name":"FixIt","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"2 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/FixIt","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Python"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Python"}]},"readme":null,"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"A predictive text-to-speech keyboard that allows a user with speech impairment to communicate with others","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM5NDg1MDc=","name":"Speech-Assist","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"2 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Speech-Assist","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Python"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Python"}]},"readme":{"text":"# Speech-Assist\n\n## How to install\n\nClone github repository to your local machine\n\nBefore using, please write this in terminal:\n\n1)\tpip3 install kivy\n2)\tpip3 install nltk\n3)\tpython3\n4)\timport nltk\n5)\tnltk.download(‘gutenberg’)\n6)\tpip3 install marisa_trie\n7)\tpip3 install scipy\n8)\tpip3 install gTTS\n9)\tbrew install mpg321\n\n\nCD into the repository\nRun python3 keyboard.py\n\n\n"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"QHacks 2018 - 9x9 Variant of Tic-Tac-Toe","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjAxOTEyODM=","name":"Tic-Hack-Toe","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"2 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Tic-Hack-Toe","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Swift"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Swift"}]},"readme":null,"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"Using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm, I found the cheapest route to get from point A to point B","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjk2NTkyNDY=","name":"Shortest_Path","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"2 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Shortest_Path","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Java"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Java"}]},"readme":{"text":"# Shortest_Path\nUsing BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm, I found the cheapest route to get from point A to point B\n"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":null,"forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY0OTMxODI=","name":"Sorting_Algorithms","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"3 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Sorting_Algorithms","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Java"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Java"}]},"readme":{"text":"# Sorting_Algorithms"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":null,"forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY0OTE0MTY=","name":"Binary-Search-Tree-and-Linked-List","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"3 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Binary-Search-Tree-and-Linked-List","primaryLanguage":{"name":"C"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"C"}]},"readme":{"text":"# Binary-Search-Tree-and-Linked-List"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":null,"forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY0OTA0NDc=","name":"Matrices_Calculator","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"3 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Matrices_Calculator","primaryLanguage":{"name":"C"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Makefile"},{"name":"C"}]},"readme":null,"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":null,"forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYyNTIyMDA=","name":"SimpleBlockchain","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"3 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/SimpleBlockchain","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Java"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Java"}]},"readme":null,"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}},{"description":"Final highschool project, working with graphical user interfaces, objects, and classes.","forkCount":0,"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY3MjgxNTk=","name":"Java-GUI","openGraphImageUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13068219?s=400&v=4","updatedAt":"3 years ago","url":"https://github.com/tasmainian/Java-GUI","primaryLanguage":{"name":"Java"},"languages":{"nodes":[{"name":"Java"}]},"readme":{"text":"# Java-GUI\nFinal highschool project, working with graphical user interfaces, objects, and classes.\n"},"stargazers":{"totalCount":0}}]}}}}]}}}
